Discord-Linux is a wrapper for [DiscordApp](http://discordapp.com/). This was made for those who would like to run Discord under it's own program on Linux. There are two different flavours of Discord-Linux; x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit).

At the moment it is in a very simple state and will be updated frequently. If you find any issues, write it up in the issues tab and I'll see what I can do.

## FAQ

Q : Why am I not getting notices from mentions, messages, etc?

A : **Make sure you check your settings and enable notices. Most of the time, on first startup, notices are turned off by default.**

Q : How come Push to Talk doesn't work?

A : **Unfortunately, Discord-Linux is just a wrapper, which means it will act like the web version of Discord. So that means no full Push to Talk support. Sorry.**
